        <p>It was a beautiful day on November 22nd, the day we had to take a study tour of LUMS University with our beloved teacher Professor Nadeem Chaudhry, Who were organizing and leading this tour. According to Sir Nadeem's instructions, all the students completed their vaccination, which was mandatory to go there. At the same time, everyone had made their own vaccination cards and handed them over to class monitor Shabir Usmani.  We all started preparing from last night. Every student was busy with some work. Someone was pressing their clothes and someone was polishing their shoes. This was the first opportunity for each of us so every One was excited. To go on tour, we had booked 1 wagon of Ashrafia Educational Trust and some colleagues had to sit in his car with Sir Nadeem.</p>
